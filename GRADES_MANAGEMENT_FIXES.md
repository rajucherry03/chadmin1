**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive database schema (`src/utils/gradesDatabaseSchema.js`)
- Implemented all required collections with proper field definitions
- Added proper indexing for performance optimization
- Included business rules and validation logic

**Collections Implemented**:
- `students` - Student information and academic records
- `programs` - Academic programs and curricula
- `courses` - Course information and syllabi
- `exams` - Examination schedules and configurations
- `enrollments` - Student course enrollments
- `marks` - Individual student marks for examinations
